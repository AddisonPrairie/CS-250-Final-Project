abstract = {A central tool in constructing pseudorandom generators, secure encryption functions, and in other areas are “hard-core” predicates b of functions (permutations) undefined, discovered in [Blum Micali 82]. Such b(x) cannot be efficiently guessed (substantially better than 50-50) given only undefined(x). Both b, undefined are computable in polynomial time.[Yao 82] transforms any one-way function undefined into a more complicated one, undefined*, which has a hard-core predicate. The construction applies the original undefined to many small pieces of the input to undefined* just to get one “hard-core” bit. The security of this bit may be smaller than any constant positive power of the security of undefined. In fact, for inputs (to undefined*) of practical size, the pieces effected by undefined are so small that undefined can be inverted (and the “hard-core” bit computed) by exhaustive search.In this paper we show that every one-way function, padded to the form undefined(p, x) = (p, g(x)), ‖‖p‖‖ = ‖x‖, has by itself a hard-core predicate of the same (within a polynomial) security. Namely, we prove a conjecture of [Levin 87, sec. 5.6.2] that the scalar product of Boolean vectors p, x is a hard-core of every one-way function undefined(p, x) = (p, g(x)). The result extends to multiple (up to the logarithm of security) such bits and to any distribution on the x's for which undefined is hard to invert.},
